# ðŸ§  Local LLM Chatbot (WebLLM + React)

This is a chatbot powered by [@mlc-ai/web-llm](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) that runs completely in the browser â€” no internet or server required after setup!

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses RedPajama 3B model
- Fully runs in-browser using WebGPU (no API key needed)
- Works on modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Edge)
- Lightweight UI built with React + Tailwind CSS

## Notes
- **WebGPU support is required** (only works on modern Chromium-based browsers like Chrome/Edge).
- Works best on **desktop/laptops** with GPU support.
- May not work on low-end or mobile devices due to limited GPU power and WebGPU support.
